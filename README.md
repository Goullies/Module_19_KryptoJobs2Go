## Blockchain Wallet Challenge

![Screenshots_original](Screen_Shot.png)

### Background...
The task was to work at a fictional startup that is building a new and disruptive application named KryptoJobs2Go. Customers use KryptoJobs2Go to find fintech professionals from a list of candidates, hire them, and then pay them. I have integrated the Ethereum blockchain network into the application to enable the customers to instantly pay their hired fintech professionals with cryptocurrency.

#### This was done by the following steps;

1.  Import Ethereum transaction functions into the KryptoJobs2Go application.
2.  Sign and run a payment transaction.
3.  Inspect the transaction in Ganache.

#### The following screens shots support these outcomes:
